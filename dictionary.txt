exponential - Exponential functions are functions of that have a fixed base b that could be any positive real number. Exponential functions are often associated with exponential growth, which means that that there is a consistent fixed period over which the function will double (or triple, or quadruple, etc.) and the change is always a fixed proportion.
function - The function is a general relation between a set of input values (domain) and corresponding set of output values (co-domain). It relates each element of a set (domain) with exactly one element of another set (co-domain). Every element in domain must have a corresponding value in co-domain. A function is single valued. It can't give two or more output values for the same input.
logarithmic - Logarithmic functions are the inverses of exponential functions. The inverse of the exponential function y = ax is x = ay. The logarithmic function y = logax is defined to be equivalent to the exponential equation x = ay. y = logax only under the following conditions: x = ay, a > 0, and a≠1. It is called the logarithmic function with base a.
polynomial - A polynomial function has the form, where are real numbers and n is a non negative integer. In other words, a polynomial is the sum of one or more monomials with real coefficients and non negative integer exponents. The degree of the polynomial function is the highest value for n where an is not equal to 0.
